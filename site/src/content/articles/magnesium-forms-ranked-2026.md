Dr. Berg ranks magnesium supplement forms by absorption rate and effectiveness:

1. **Worst** - Magnesium oxide: Only 4% absorption, yet most common and expensive
2. Magnesium sulfate: 10% absorption, high laxative effect
3. Better options include magnesium glycinate, citrate, and threonate for different purposes
