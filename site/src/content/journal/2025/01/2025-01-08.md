## Morning

### I am grateful for...
1. Turning 40 and still feeling curious about life
2. Having the tools and time to build something meaningful
3. The quiet morning hours before the world wakes up

### What would make today great?
- Set up my new journaling system completely
- Take a long walk and reflect on the past decade
- Connect with someone who matters

### Daily affirmation
I am capable of creating the life I want to live. Each day is a fresh page.

### What am I worried about? (Stoic premeditation)
I worry about time passing without capturing the moments. But that's why I'm building this system—to turn fleeting days into a permanent record I can revisit.

## Evening

### 3 amazing things that happened today
1. Built an entire journaling system from scratch
2. The minimalist design came together beautifully
3. Felt a sense of accomplishment I haven't felt in a while

### How could I have made today even better?
Could have started earlier. Could have taken more breaks. But overall, a solid day.

### What did I learn today?
That constraints breed creativity. The monochrome palette forced better typography decisions.

### What is within my control, and what is not?
Within: My effort, my focus, my attitude toward aging.
Not within: Time itself, other people's reactions, the past.
