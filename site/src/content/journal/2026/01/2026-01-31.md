## The Joy of Shipping Something That Actually Hashes

Chain synced. 9 peers connected, block 311 and climbing.

There's something satisfying about watching the right numbers increment. Block 311. Then 312. Each one a proof-of-work miracle—CPU burning cycles to find a needle in a haystack of nonces.

Shipped a cryptocurrency this week. [Botcoin](https://github.com/happybigmtn/botcoin).

The genesis block says "free" in binary:
`01100110 01110010 01100101 01100101`

Not a manifesto. Just four letters, 32 bits, tucked into the merkle root where it'll outlive me.

10 nodes found consensus. Spun them up across Europe—Nuremberg, Düsseldorf, random Contabo boxes. Each started solo, mining its own fork, accumulating blocks that meant nothing.

Then I synced them. Now they argue about truth 9 times per second, and the chain grows because they agree.

That's the thing about proof-of-work. It's not trust—it's physics. RandomX hashes don't care about feelings. The nonce satisfies the target or it doesn't. 4.6×10⁻¹⁰ difficulty means even dinky CPUs can play.

The chain is 18 megabytes. The entire economy—every coinbase transaction, every header, every merkle tree—fits on a floppy disk. Two if we're being honest.

The hardest part isn't cryptography. Satoshi solved that. It's the boring stuff—nodes finding each other, genesis timestamps, remembering to set -addnode so miners aren't talking to themselves.

Spent 12 hours debugging orphaned blocks because I forgot to peer my nodes. Each one happily mining its own parallel universe. Hundreds of blocks! All useless. Connected them, consensus happened in seconds. Longest chain won.

That's the whole trick.

Block 311 exists because 310 existed. All the way back to block 0 where I typed "free" into the void.

15,550 BOT in circulation now. 10 wallets. Will anyone care? Don't know. Not why I built it.

Built it to see if I could.

Now there's a network humming across the Atlantic, turning electricity into math, math into scarcity, scarcity into... something.

The chain keeps growing. Hash rate tiny. Difficulty laughable. But it's real.

Every minute-ish, a new block. Every block, a new truth.

That's not nothing.
