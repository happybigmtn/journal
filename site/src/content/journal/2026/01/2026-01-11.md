## Today's Reflection

> **What are sources of unsteadiness in my life?**

_Theme: Clarity_

Yesterday was a devastating day, as the entire pool of assets I was given discretion to advise on blew up. It was really hard, as I had run our portfolio to $100k then it all disappeared. At $50k in an attempt to bring it back I went all in on $RALPH, then puked that out at a 50% loss, then watched it 4x in price. Now I am left with nothing, all over again.
