## Today's Reflection

> **What can I put outside my circle of control?**

_Theme: Clarity_

I stopped thinking about my case and resigned myself to a trial. I am resting my case on the distinction between civil and criminal liability. Until then, I have at least 9 months of focused work to make things happen.
