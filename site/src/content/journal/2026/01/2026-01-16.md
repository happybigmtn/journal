## Today's Reflection

> **What assumptions have I left unquestioned?**

_Theme: Clarity_

Today was an emotionally charged day. It started by waking up to limit order sales of over $60k worth of $RALPH, resulting in over $80k of profit over the lifetime of the trade (2 days). It was a bit like how it felt during peak NFT days. Then there was COW, which 10x'd versus yesterday, and amazingly, it's still early. The flip side of all that was an utter inability to focus on anything, just a feeling that wherever I was running, I had to go faster. It was quite the contrast to the focused, relaxed pace of linear algebra from yesterday. To celebrate we had a bottle of champagne and watched what ended up being an emotionally charged movie about one man's gambling addicitions and the path it led him to. It got me quite emotional remembering just how much pain I've been through. To have gone through all that, and suffered as much as I did, and then lost it all to something so stupid, it was the universe telling me that my time to relax has not yet come. Put me to work. I've been training for this for the last year and a half. From all this, I resolved to fight. I'm tired of optimizing for what the world thinks, and even though I've done wrong, what I did not have was an intent to defraud anyone.

This is what I told Kristoff: "I cannot in good conscience plea to an intent that I did not have. I could plead guilty to all losses foreseeably linked to some 'intent to gamble' at the time that I was raising the money. For me, that is the full $1.3m I lost by casino gambling. I could see how they might argue for extending this to the seed round monies I lost by leveraged trading, even though I think it's a stretch given the discussions with the seed investors about bitcoin treasury investments. Nevertheless I'd be willing to do it for the sake of clarity around timelines to keep building. But to go beyond that to say that ALL of the money I raised, including angel funds that were spent on corporate expenses and token round investments which were always linked to a future token launch (and conferred no equity rights in the company), when I'm going to deliver on substantially all the product promisese I made to investors ... I just don't know why I would destroy any chances the project has at success by pleading guilty to an intent that I did not have (as reinforced by how I've spent the last 1.5 years). Part of why I'm so insistent that the scope of my guilty plea be limited to the casino gambling is because I think that's a story I can tell the public, about how I was overcome by the urge to trade after taking control over the investment funds ... but to suggest that the entire startup was based on a lie, that is too much for me to accept. The moment this becomes a story about how I absconded with $7m+, not only is that factually inaccurate, but it destroys the narrative of the project and my heartfelt intent to build this project. And if it takes having to go to court to tell that story to correct this fundamental misunderstanding, then that's something I feel I have to do. I already feel admitting to a guilty plea to the entire seed round financing is a great stretch for me, and to take it beyond that ... it's just warping reality to mold an outside narrative, nowhere near the actual truth of what happened. That's where I'm at, and I fully acknowledge it may be too far apart, but to me this is not about a negotiation. It's about telling what happened for what it was, rather than reinventing a new story after the fact."

### How could I have made today even better?

### What did I learn today?

“If you want to be really great something, you have to truly care about it. If you want to be great in a particular area, you have to obsess over it. A lot of people say they want to be great, but they are not willing to make the sacrifices necessary to achieve greatness.

They have other concerns, whether important or not, and they spread themselves out. That’s totally fine. After all, greatness is not for everybody.

What I’m saying is greatness isn’t easy to achieve. It requires a lot of time, a lot of sacrifices. It requires a lot of tough choices. It requires your loved ones to sacrifice, too, so you have to have an understanding circle of family and friends. People don’t always understand how much effort from how many people goes into one person chasing a dream to be great.”
