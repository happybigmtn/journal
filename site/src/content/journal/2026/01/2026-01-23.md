## Today's Reflection

> **Which of my possessions own me?**

_Theme: Clarity_

I solved this problem by letting Anna own everything. That way, I can focus on what I really care about.

The last few days have been focused on getting Loom setup. I'm very happy that it's fully running now. It's basically a remote execution environment for all my claude code sessions with full sudo access to ephemeral kubernetes clusters.
