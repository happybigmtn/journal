## Today's Reflection

> **How can I keep my mind clear from pollution?**

_Theme: Clarity_

I want to get to a state of mental clarity, free from the clutter and distractions that often cloud my thinking. This means being mindful of the information I consume, the people I interact with, and the habits I cultivate. By simplifying my environment and focusing on what truly matters, I can achieve a clearer mind and make better decisions.

I had this thought in the sauna that I can barely remember what happened in my 30s. I want my 40s to be marked by intentionality, and that requires detailed logs of what happened each day, and how I felt. So I created this journaling system using Claude Code to help me capture my daily reflections, habits, and learnings.
