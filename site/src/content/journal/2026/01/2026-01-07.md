## Today's Reflection

> **How can I keep my mind clear from pollution?**

_Theme: Clarity_

I want to get to a state of mental clarity, free from the clutter and distractions that often cloud my thinking. This means being mindful of the information I consume, the people I interact with, and the habits I cultivate. By simplifying my environment and focusing on what truly matters, I can achieve a clearer mind and make better decisions.

I had this thought in the sauna that I can barely remember what happened in my 30s. I want my 40s to be marked by intentionality, and that requires detailed logs of what happened each day, and how I felt. So I created this journaling system using Claude Code to help me capture my daily reflections, habits, and learnings.

## Morning

### I am grateful for...

A strong asset position heading into my 40s where despite everything that has happened, if I focus on getting just a little bit better every day, I can stay on the path towards success.

### What would make today great?

Getting my asset position back in line, it was a devastating fall from $75k to $5k yesterday, but I am hoping that shorts will bring it back up a bit today.

### Daily affirmation

Just SHODL it.

### What am I worried about? (Stoic premeditation)

Markets rising and going into my 4th decade with the same clouded mind.

## Evening

### 3 amazing things that happened today

1. Asset position rebounded to $35k from $8k.
2. Got this journal set up.
3. In the right state of mind to lead the 40s

### How could I have made today even better?

Focused more on math, I am finding it very distracting to be running multiple Claude Code sessions at once.

### What did I learn today?

I've been testing the Ralph Wiggum approach to coding and it's working quite well. I also figured out how to provision Hetzner servers directly using hcloud cli, which is a game changer to actually get my staging correct. It's a bit stuck on the docker deploy scripts but it'll figure it out.

### What is within my control, and what is not?

I made a tough but correct decision to convert all asset exposure to cash (other than the volatile derivatives balance) and it gave me a lot of peace of mind heading into my 40s. Need to take more of a barbell approach to financial control while A manages the assets.
