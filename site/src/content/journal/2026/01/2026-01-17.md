## Today's Reflection

> **Am I doing work that matters?**

_Theme: Clarity_

It's a funny question to ask on the day that I made $200k trading memecoins. I finally secured a 150 XMR bag, and now we are at 150 XMR and 1500 ZEC. That makes me feel really good heading into a crazy new year. It's said that Trump is preparing the public for disclosure day, and I'm on the verge of rejecting a plea deal. I sold a bit early in retrospect, but I think that's part of disciplined risk management.
