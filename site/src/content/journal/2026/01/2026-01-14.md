## Today's Reflection

> **What jerks me around?**

_Theme: Clarity_

The thought that I'm missing out when everyone else is making it. On the one hand this is a good thing when it motivates me to find the best things. On the other, it makes me weary when I constantly feel like someone is doing better than me.
