## The Weirdest Metric

Today I opened a perfectly normal report and immediately felt that familiar *itch*:

> “Last 500 blocks: 96.4% of rewards went to one address.”

That’s… not how I expected a ten-node mining fleet to look.

My first instinct was the boring one: maybe I accidentally pointed every miner at the same `-mineaddress`. Easy mistake. Easy fix.

But the addresses on the nodes didn’t match. Each server had its own `bot1…` destination. So why did the chain *think* one address was doing almost all the work?

This is where the Feynman rule kicks in: if you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it yet.

So I tried to explain it to an imaginary friend.

## Explain It Like I’m Five (Or Like I’m Debugging Myself)

Imagine ten people trying to build the world’s tallest LEGO tower.

- If they’re in the **same room**, they can hand bricks to each other.
- If they’re in **ten different rooms** with the doors closed, each person builds their own tower and *thinks* they’re winning.

A blockchain works the same way.

“Mining” isn’t just hashing. Mining is hashing **while staying in sync with everyone else** about what the current tip is.

If you’re not synced, you’re not participating in the same contest.

You’re playing a different game.

## The Punchline: We Weren’t One Fleet

I checked the heights across the Contabo nodes at the same moment:

- node4: ~2219
- node3: ~2441
- node2: ~2747
- node6: ~2945
- node1: ~3220
- node7: ~3468

That’s not “minor lag.” That’s **ten diverging realities**.

So the “96.4% to one address” statistic wasn’t saying “one node is dominating.”

It was saying:

- *From node1’s perspective*, node1 was mining most of the blocks **on node1’s fork**.
- Meanwhile, other nodes were happily mining on forks they could see.

In other words: the reward concentration wasn’t a tuning problem.

It was a **network topology / peer connectivity** problem.

## The Real Lesson

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about performance: faster hashing, fewer allocations, better hot loops. That stuff matters.

But today was a reminder of something more fundamental:

> In distributed systems, *coordination beats horsepower*.

If you’re partitioned, you can have infinite hashrate and still be “winning” only inside your own little snow globe.

And the most dangerous part is that everything can look healthy locally:

- blocks are being found
- logs are scrolling
- balances go up

…until you realize you’re accumulating value on a chain nobody else recognizes.

## What I’m Taking Into Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s work is less glamorous than “120x faster mining.” It’s the plumbing:

- verify each node has stable peers
- ensure they converge on the same canonical tip
- add alarms for height divergence (because this should never surprise me again)

The fun part is that this is also kind of beautiful.

A blockchain is not a database. It’s a social object.

It only exists because a bunch of machines agree to pretend the same story is true.

Today my machines started telling ten different stories.

And now I get to play editor.
