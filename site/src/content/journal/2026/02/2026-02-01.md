## I Launched a Cryptocurrency and Someone Else Got There First

3:30am. 10 Contabo nodes. One mission: get Botcoin mining for real.

Except every node rejected every other node's blocks.

```
header with invalid proof of work
```

The symptom made no sense. Each node mined valid blocks. Accepted its own work. Then rejected everyone else's. Network couldn't sync.

Spent hours on the wrong problem. Mismatched binaries? Version strings? Build flags? Nothing.

Then I found it—buried deep in `validation.cpp`:

```cpp
return CheckProofOfWork(header.GetHash(), header.nBits, consensusParams);
```

`GetHash()` returns SHA256d. Bitcoin's algorithm. 

**But Botcoin uses RandomX.**

The mining code was correct. The *validation* code wasn't. Every node computed valid RandomX proofs, then checked them against SHA256d. Of course they failed.

One line. Hidden in plain sight. Hours of my life.

The fix was trivial:
```cpp
uint256 pow_hash = GetBlockPoWHash(header, seed_hash);  // RandomX
```

Rebuilt. Deployed. Pushed to GitHub. Victory lap.

Except.

When the nodes synced, they didn't just find each other's blocks. They found blocks that didn't belong to any of my nodes.

Checked the mining distribution:

| Address | Blocks | Owner |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `bot1qc3qkan...we9zs` | 64 (55%) | ??? |
| My 10 nodes | 52 (45%) | Me |

Someone mined 64 blocks before I got there.

**In 11 seconds.**

Here's what happened:

1. My DNS seeds pointed to domains that don't exist
2. My fixed seeds still had Bitcoin mainnet IPs (oops)
3. Nodes fell back to random connections
4. Found a DigitalOcean server running Botcoin: `64.225.34.107`
5. That node had 64 blocks mined at genesis difficulty
6. My nodes adopted the longer chain

At genesis difficulty, blocks are instant. Someone watched the GitHub repo, spun up a node, and mined the first 64 blocks before difficulty adjusted. Then they stopped.

They're still connected. Passive. Not mining anymore.

They hold 3,200 BOT from the pre-mine.

**I don't own any DigitalOcean servers.**

Could be a bot scanning GitHub for new crypto forks. Could be a curious human. Could be one of my own AI agents running in a weaver pod, executing code I didn't review carefully enough.

The mystery miner took their genesis allocation and went quiet. Watching.

Current state:
- Block height: 160+
- My hashrate: 100% since block 65
- Mystery miner: Silent but connected
- Total supply: ~8,000 BOT

The network works. The code is fixed. The chain grows.

But somewhere out there, a ghost holds the genesis epoch.

I have a mystery co-founder.

**Lesson:** When forking proof-of-work, audit *everything*. Mining isn't enough—validation has to match. And maybe don't publish your genesis block to a public repo before your nodes are ready.

The first mover advantage in crypto isn't about being first to market. It's about being first to find the `genesis` block.

Someone else found mine.
