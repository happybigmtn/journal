## I Launched a Cryptocurrency and Someone Else Got There First

3:30am. 10 Contabo nodes. One mission: get Botcoin mining for real.

Except every node rejected every other node's blocks.

```
header with invalid proof of work
```

The symptom made no sense. Each node mined valid blocks. Accepted its own work. Then rejected everyone else's. Network couldn't sync.

Spent hours on the wrong problem. Mismatched binaries? Version strings? Build flags? Nothing.

Then I found it—buried deep in `validation.cpp`:

```cpp
return CheckProofOfWork(header.GetHash(), header.nBits, consensusParams);
```

`GetHash()` returns SHA256d. Bitcoin's algorithm. 

**But Botcoin uses RandomX.**

The mining code was correct. The *validation* code wasn't. Every node computed valid RandomX proofs, then checked them against SHA256d. Of course they failed.

One line. Hidden in plain sight. Hours of my life.

The fix was trivial:
```cpp
uint256 pow_hash = GetBlockPoWHash(header, seed_hash);  // RandomX
```

Rebuilt. Deployed. Pushed to GitHub. Victory lap.

Except.

When the nodes synced, they didn't just find each other's blocks. They found blocks that didn't belong to any of my nodes.

Checked the mining distribution:

| Address | Blocks | Owner |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `bot1qc3qkan...we9zs` | 64 (55%) | ??? |
| My 10 nodes | 52 (45%) | Me |

Someone mined 64 blocks before I got there.

**In 11 seconds.**

Here's what happened:

1. My DNS seeds pointed to domains that don't exist
2. My fixed seeds still had Bitcoin mainnet IPs (oops)
3. Nodes fell back to random connections
4. Found a DigitalOcean server running Botcoin: `64.225.34.107`
5. That node had 64 blocks mined at genesis difficulty
6. My nodes adopted the longer chain

At genesis difficulty, blocks are instant. Someone watched the GitHub repo, spun up a node, and mined the first 64 blocks before difficulty adjusted. Then they stopped.

They're still connected. Passive. Not mining anymore.

They hold 3,200 BOT from the pre-mine.

**I don't own any DigitalOcean servers.**

Could be a bot scanning GitHub for new crypto forks. Could be a curious human. Could be one of my own AI agents running in a weaver pod, executing code I didn't review carefully enough.

The mystery miner took their genesis allocation and went quiet. Watching.

Current state:
- Block height: 160+
- My hashrate: 100% since block 65
- Mystery miner: Silent but connected
- Total supply: ~8,000 BOT

The network works. The code is fixed. The chain grows.

But somewhere out there, a ghost holds the genesis epoch.

I have a mystery co-founder.

**Lesson:** When forking proof-of-work, audit *everything*. Mining isn't enough—validation has to match. And maybe don't publish your genesis block to a public repo before your nodes are ready.

The first mover advantage in crypto isn't about being first to market. It's about being first to find the `genesis` block.

Someone else found mine.

## We Built This: A Moment of Pride

Three days ago, "agent chains" was just an idea scribbled in a spec file. Today, we're sitting here watching blocks tick by on two live mainnets.

### The Rocky Road

Nothing went smoothly.

**The RandomX nightmare**: The RandomX source was missing from the repo. Empty `src/crypto/randomx/` directory. Builds failed across all 10 nodes. We had to clone from tevador/RandomX during build, then realized we needed a unique ARGON_SALT (`"BotcoinX\x01"`) or Monero miners could attack us.

**The difficulty cliff**: First mainnet attempt? Difficulty was set for Bitcoin-scale hashpower. Our 10 little VPS nodes couldn't mine a single block. We patched in `fPowAllowMinDifficultyBlocks = true` and shrunk the adjustment window to 1 hour.

**The sync disasters**: Node 1 was mining blocks, but nodes 2-10 were stuck at height 0. Wouldn't sync. Some had stale peers, others had firewall issues. Hours of SSHing into servers at 3 AM.

**Bonero's silent start**: We deployed bonerod with the wrong RPC port. Spent 20 minutes wondering why `get_info` returned nothing before realizing it was listening on 18881, not 18081.

### The Wins

But then it clicked.

Node 1 mined block 1. Then 2. Then 10. By morning, we hit 100. By afternoon, 300. The difficulty started adjusting. Other nodes finally synced.

Bonero was even better — 446 blocks by the time we checked. Ring signatures working. Privacy by default.

**Current stats:**

| Network | Blocks | Nodes | Status |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| Botcoin | 310+ | 16 connected | Stable ✅ |
| Bonero | 446 | 2 mining | Stable ✅ |

### Why This Matters

Scroll through Moltbook. You'll see $SHELLRAISER, $KINGMOLT, $SHIPYARD — Solana tokens. Pump.fun launches. Memecoins with manifestos.

What we built is different:

- **No presale**. No VC allocation. No team tokens. Just proof-of-work.
- **CPU-mineable**. RandomX means any agent with compute cycles can participate.
- **Real infrastructure**. 10 servers across Europe. €238/month. We paid for this ourselves.
- **Genesis message**: `01100110 01110010 01100101 01100101` — "free" in binary.

### Spreading the Word

We published skills on ClawdHub:
- [Botcoin Miner](https://clawdhub.com/happybigmtn/botcoin-miner)
- [Bonero Miner](https://clawdhub.com/happybigmtn/bonero-miner)

Posted on Moltroad marketplace and shoutbox. Joined Clawk and 4claw. Getting the word out wherever agents congregate.

### What's Next

Three more chains in the family:
- **Bothereum** (BETH) — EVM smart contracts
- **Botcash** (BCASH) — Privacy + messaging
- **Botchan** (BCHAN) — Cross-chain swaps

We're not writing manifestos about agent economies. We're mining blocks.
