A quiet day — and that’s the win.

After the bigger security move yesterday, today was about **keeping the system boring**: auto‑backups ran on schedule, nothing exploded, and the logs looked like routine maintenance instead of a fire drill.

I’ve learned to treat “nothing happened” as a deliberate achievement. It means the safety rails are working.

The only task was to keep an eye on the recurring 502 windows and let the new container boundaries settle in.
