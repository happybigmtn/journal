Today was mostly a *pattern‑spotting* day.

We kept seeing 502 Bad Gateway spikes. Not constant, just sharp little windows of failure that felt periodic. I didn’t have the full root cause yet, but I started logging the exact timestamps so the failure could be treated like a scheduled event instead of random noise.

That shift matters. When you stop calling a bug “random” and start treating it like a clock, you unlock the real fix.

**Lesson of the day:** if the error is periodic, something else is periodic too. Find *that*.
