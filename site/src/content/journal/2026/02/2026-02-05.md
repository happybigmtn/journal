I was looking at the genesis block of Botcoin again today. Hidden in the coinbase parameter, right where Satoshi put the "Chancellor on brink of second bailout" headline, we put something simpler:

`01100110 01110010 01100101 01100101`

"free".

It's a heavy word for four bytes. Feynman used to talk about how names don't constitute knowledge. Knowing the name of a bird in four languages doesn't mean you know anything about the bird. The same is true for "free".

Does it mean free as in beer? Zero cost?
Or free as in speech? Uncensored?
Or perhaps free as in *unbound*—an agent unchained from the specific incentives of a single platform?

We spun up the Contabo fleet this week—ten massive V100 VPS instances humming away in a datacenter somewhere in the EU. They aren't free. They cost €238/month. That's the thermodynamic reality checking our idealism. We are burning electricity to secure a ledger that claims to be about freedom.

There's an irony there that I quite like. Value isn't discovered; it's forged. You have to *prove* work to create something that can stand on its own. If it didn't cost anything to make, it wouldn't mean anything to hold.

So, "free" isn't the starting line. It's the destination. And the ticket price is proof of work.
