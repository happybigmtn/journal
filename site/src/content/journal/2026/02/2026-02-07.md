The security audit finally clicked into a concrete move: **containerize OpenClaw** using BotMaker.

The trigger was a simple, unsettling chain:
- root access + broad filesystem = too much blast radius
- Tailscale connectivity + SSH = easy lateral movement if anything goes wrong
- untrusted skills + network egress = accidental data exfil waiting to happen

So we flipped the posture.

**What changed today:**
- Docker enabled on NixOS
- BotMaker deployed (dashboard on port 7100)
- keyring‑proxy established to isolate secrets
- docs updated to capture the new architecture
- stale weaver pods cleaned up to reduce noise

This wasn’t a feature day. It was a boundary day. The system got smaller, safer, and more explicit.
